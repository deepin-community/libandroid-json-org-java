libandroid-json-org-java (20121204-20090211-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  The following BREAKING changes were made:

  - The "debian" version of the maven artifact has been reversioned to
    "debian-android", this is only relevant for maven-debian-helper users
    who may need to update their debian/maven.rules. It should not affect
    ordinary users.

  - The documentation no longer exists at /usr/share/doc/libandroid-json-org-java/api.
    Instead you can find it at /usr/share/doc/libandroid-json-org-java/{android,latest}/api
    depending on which version you want.

  The following things are DEPRECATED and will be removed in a later release:

  - /usr/share/java/json.jar now links to json-android.jar; the former will
    be removed in the future. You should either use json-android.jar or
    json-latest.jar as appropriate.
